      <p style="font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace; color: brown">Embedded Software and Web Developer</p>
      <p>Hello, I'm Bryce Rega. I'm a junior Computer Engineering major at Iowa State University. I've always had a
        software background, and my interests range from the lowest embedded software to top level web development.</p>

        <h3>Autonomous Roomba</h3>
        <p>This project is related to Iowa State University's embedded systems class (CprE 288). This project involved
          using the datasheet for a TI chip to configure the microcontroller mounted on the Roomba to work in our favor.
          This ended up being an autonomous Roomba project where the microcontroller interfaced with different sensors
          and commanded the motors to get the Roomba to go where it needed to go. The target was selected on a GUI
          developed in Python and the data was relayed to the Roomba over WiFi.</p>

        <h3>Cruise Control</h3>
        <p>This project was completed for PrISUm-- Iowa State's solar car team. This solar powered vehicle, Eliana, runs
          on two electric motors. The motor controllers use Mitsuba Motor Controllers (being installed in this picture)
          which help command the motors. A custom board was made to interface with the motor controllers. I developed
          the embedded software for this board. This included a custom cruise control developed form scratch. After some
          testing and tuning, the cruise control now works like any other.</p>
